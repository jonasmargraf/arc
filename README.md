Arc offers space to pause, decelerate, and sensitize oneâ€™s perception. The vastness of the architecture, the view of the river Spree, the sounds and their movement in space create an environment that invites visitors to linger.

The material of the composition was derived from analog and digital processes and synthesis, field recordings and performed sound recordings.

A self-developed control software facilitates the movement of sounds in space.

### Technical Notes
24 channel audio spatialization software for Arc, an ambient sound installation commissioned for Superbooth 2016.

For the installation, 24 speakers were hung overhead along the ceiling of an almost 80m long, arched hallway in the historic Funkhaus building in Berlin.

The system is written in JavaScript, Max 7 and Max4Live with Ableton Live 9.2.
It is set up to be adaptable to any number of speakers, but is currently configured for 24 channels.
Sounds are sequenced in Ableton Live and then routed to Max using Jack.
